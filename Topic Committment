# Topic Committment


For my white paper I have decided to write from a professionals perspective addressing the effects of good branding and why all companies need to have it. It will include statistics on how good branding efects sales, encourages trust, captures the loyalty of customers, etc. 


1. What - Branding: developng a brand image for a company
2. Why - Branding greatly effects a company's success
3. Whether - Whether or not a compny makes grt eforts with branding will effect their business
4. How - Brands establish trust and emotionl responses with the consumer. If you take away branding, you take away the customer's connection with  brand as well as their loyalty.
