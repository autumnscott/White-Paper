This source discusses the benefits art has on students. It talks about how art can increase the motivation to learn, social skills, reading and language skills, mathematical skills, and can also improve a school environment. 

Keywords and Phrases: 
- Learning in the arts

What this source led me to: http://www.artsedsearch.org/study/learning-in-and-through-the-arts-the-question-of-transfer/
Using keywords I found within the first source led me to to find this additional source. This source discusses a correlation between art and test scores. The study shows that children who are exposed to a higher level of art education are found to score higher on tests.

* I'm not sure these sources will pertain to my topic for my white paper! Still trying to piece together a topic. I'm either going to be discussing the general benefits of art in a person's life or how art can be used as a marketing tool to get a money-making response out of people.
