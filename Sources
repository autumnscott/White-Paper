What this source led me to: http://www.artsedsearch.org/study/learning-in-and-through-the-arts-the-question-of-transfer/
Using keywords I found within the first source led me to to find this additional source. This source discusses a correlation between art and test scores. The study shows that children who are exposed to a higher level of art education are found to score higher on tests.

* I'm not sure these sources will pertain to my topic for my white paper! Still trying to piece together a topic. I'm either going to be discussing the general benefits of art in a person's life or how art can be used as a marketing tool to get a money-making response out of people.
