# Abstract

For my white paper, I will be delving into the depths of creativity. Does creativity come naturally to human beings? Is creativity beneficial to our health? Why do humans have the desire to create? Is creativity an important form of expression people should be partaking in? These are some of the questions I will be looking to answer within my paper. I will be looking to highlight the importance of creativity within a person's life, and how it can mentally benefit us. I believe creativity comes to all human beings naturally; people just show their creativity in different ways. After all, we are all made in the image of God, and he is the ultimate creator. I find it hard to believe that humans are not meant to find joy in creation, when we are modelled after the most brilliant creator of all time. Clearly creativity has some level of importance in our lives. Psychologically, humans need to experience creativity in order to feel fulfillment. In the famous Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Maslow outlines the basic needs all human beings absolutely need to have met. Things such as shelter, safety, food and water will appear on the hierarchy. Next comes creativity. Creativity isn't just making art. Creativity is developing solutions to complex problems, designing products, and coming up with new ideas. When we overcome obstacles because we thought creatively, we feel that we have been rewarded. My paper will focus on why humans need to set aside time to be creative, how creativity can be productive, and how it improves the mind.
